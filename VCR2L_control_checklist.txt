what do i need to control

1. Eyes direction - 8 directions 
(neutral is dead ahead)

2. Expressions
* happy
*angry
*sad
*flustered
*scared
*confused
*curious
*embarassed
*neutral
*horny
*mischievous
*etc.
*blinking
*other closed-eye expressions
*asymetrical expression? 
(2 notes -- 1st is default symmetrical,
but if you add the 2nd note it overwrites
the other half)

3. effects (rolling illumination, 
LED display blinking, 
additional LED backlighting, etc.)

4. Physical looking/tilting of 
face display
(velocity 1 - 126, 127 is poke out all the way)
(1-126 is broken into 9 chunks of 14)
(each chunk represents a direction)
(1-14 is neutral resting)
15 - 28 is left
29 - 42 is right
etc.

all of this x2, one set of controls 
per character
